    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kenkey, dorkunu, dokonou, or kom is a West African sourdough dumpling-like meal popular in Togo, Benin, and Ghana. It’s commonly served with pepper sauce, shito, and fried fish or stew.</p>
    <p>It is a traditional Ghanaian meal prepared from fermented white corn that is widely consumed by Ga people from the south of the country.

        Frequently, it is served with fried fish in West Africa, where fishing is common and fish is typically eaten fresh and fried, or dried and smoked for improved preservation. Like banku and ugali, it’s commonly made from ground corn (maize).
        
        It is made by fermenting maize for at least 5 days before cooking it. As a result, the preparation takes a few days to allow the dough to ferment.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6-8 cup corn</li>
            <li>Agbelima</li>
            <li>fish(supplementary)</li>
            <li>pepper(supplementary)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large container cover the corn with just enough water to dampen all of it. Set it in a warm place, such as a warmed oven or on top of the refrigerator, for 5 days. Fermentation may take longer than two days, especially in cool climates</li>
            <li>When it is properly fermented, it should have a slightly sour, but not unpleasant aroma, rinse and grind the corn.</li>
            <li>Knead the fermented dough with your hands until it is thoroughly mixed and slightly stiffened. Divide the dough into two equal parts.</li>
            <li>n a large pot, cook one part of the fermented dough. Cook for about ten minutes, stirring constantly and vigorously. Remove from heat. This half of the dough is called the “aflata”</li>
            <li>Combine the aflata with the remaining uncooked dough. Mix well</li>
            <li>Divide the aflata-dough mixture into serving-sized pieces. Wrap the pieces tightly in corn husks, or foil. At this point you can put it in the fridge or freezer until you are ready to cook</li>
            <li>Steam the Kom for 30 to 60 mins, depending on their size and thickness. Serve room-temperature</li>
            <li>Grind 1 onion, 2 tomatoes and green chilies together, grind until smooth, but with a little texture remaining in the sauce. Add Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Season and fry your fish with some garlic, ginger, salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Serve with Yébésséssi, fried fish, sardine and Yébéssé fionfion</li>
        </ol>
