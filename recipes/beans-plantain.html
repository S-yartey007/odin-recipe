    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried Plantain usually goes with one thing and that is beans, together they are referred to as Red Red but there is another local name which is Gobe (Gob3).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ripe Plantain</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Beans</li>
        <li>Palm oil</li>
        <li>onion</li>

    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash your beans and cook for about 30 minutes or till its soft and tender</li>
        <li>While your beans are cooking clean and blend 1 onion, pepper, ginger, tomatoes and maggie crevette together. Just so you know I love blending my spices together because it gives it a nice texture and taste but you can just use the diced tomatoes without blending it.</li>

        <li>Let it cook for a minute or 2 then pour in your blended ingredients. Let that cook for about 10minutes. Meanwhile check on your bean to make sure it has enough water. I am sure by now it's getting soft and tender. Lower the temperature if it is and allow it to simmer.</li>
        <li>Now, Clean your Hutwise smoked mackerel and cut them into smaller pieces. You can then add the fish to the sauce and cook that for about 5minutes. </li>
        <li>Add your cooked beans to the sauce if it's soft and tender. Mind you if there is too much water on your beans, drain it first to avoid making your stew watery.  </li>
